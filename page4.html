      <img src="images/glass_squid.jpg" alt="A close up look at the Glass squid AKA Cranchiidae" width="400">
      <p>The glass squid, part of the Cranchiidae family, is known for its nearly transparent body, which helps it evade
        predators in the open ocean. Some species have the unique ability to store ammonia in their body fluids,
        allowing them to maintain neutral buoyancy and drift effortlessly. Additionally, their eyes are often
        asymmetrical, with one significantly larger than the other, an adaptation that enhances their ability to detect
        light and movement in the deep sea.</p>

      <img src="images/Sea_angel.jpg" alt="A well defined photograph of the Sea Angel" width="400">
      <p>Sea angels are ethereal-looking creatures with glowing, gelatinous bodies, belonging to the pteropod, or
        winged-snail, group. Unlike their shelled relatives, they have evolved into completely shell-less, free-swimming
        predators that use wing-like appendages to gracefully propel themselves through the water. Despite their
        delicate appearance, they are efficient hunters, feeding primarily on sea butterflies by using specialized
        tentacle-like structures to grasp and consume their prey.</p>

      <h2>Devil Ray</h2>
      <img src="images/DevilRay.jpg" alt="Devil Ray" width="400">
      <p> The Devil Ray is a majestic being closely related to the manta ray, yet with a few differences. despite its
        name, it is not a predator, primarily eating plankton this creature glides through the currents of speeds up to
        24 miles per hour!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>unlike the manta ray and its subspecies, the devil rays feed in schools and large groups</li>
        <li>The Devil Ray has a popular habit that makes them so unique, leaping out of the water as if they could fly!
        </li>

        <li> The devil ray has a very sleek appearance and build compared to Manta Rays</li>

      <h2 class="featured">Dumbo Octopus</h2>
      <img src="images/Dumbo.jpg" alt="A dumbo octopus, named after its resemblance to Dumbo the elephant" width="400">
      <p>The Dumbo octopus has distinctive ear-like fins that allow it to propel itself gracefully through the water,
        resembling the famous Disney elephant it is named after. Unlike many other octopuses, it does not rely on jet
        propulsion but instead flaps its fins for a more energy-efficient, drifting movement. These deep-sea dwellers
        remain relatively small, reaching an average adult size of just 8 inches, making them one of the more petite
        members of the octopus family.</p>
