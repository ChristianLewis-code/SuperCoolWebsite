            <img src="images/blue_whale.jpg" alt="The massive Blue Whale, the largest animal on Earth">
            <p>The Blue Whale is THE largest animal on earth including most dinosaurs if not all, they are also
                considered a mammal, not a fish</p>
            <ul>
                <li> a Blue Whale can end up as around 200 tons, or between 200,000 and 300,000 pounds, between the
                    weight of 25 and 30 adult elephants!</li>
                <li>Blue Whales communicate using a low frequency noise that can be heard as far as hundreds of miles</li>
                <li>They have hearts the size of a small car, weighing about 1,000 pounds</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Colossal Squid</h2>
            <img src="images/colossal_squid.jpg" alt="The mysterious Colossal Squid, a deep-sea giant">
            <p>the Colossal squid takes it's place among the largest Creatures on the planet, bigger than the more well
                known giant squid! however, it is a very rare creature and has no truly well defined appearance or
                picture, so we can only see drawings or portions of such creature, but there are a few known elements of
                such being</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, said to measure about 27cm across, about the size
                    of a sports ball!</li>
                <li>most instances have recorded this sea beast to be about 15 meters long, and between 1,100 and 1,500
                    pounds! </li>
                <li>the only known creature to be hunting the colossal squid is the famed sperm whale</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Whale Shark</h2>
            <img src="images/whale_shark.jpg" alt="The Whale Shark, the largest fish in the ocean">
            <p> The Whale Shark is the largest fish in the world and is nicknamed the gentle giant, due to its
                relatively docile nature. Despite it's massive size they only feed on small fish and plankton</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The largest recorded Whale shark was a whopping 34 tonnes, but there have been witnesses of up to 42
                    tonnes!</li>
                <li>They have over 3,000 small teeth, although they are not used to chew food</li>
                <li>they swim very slowly, as many of them can only go up to 5 mph maximum during their adolescence</li>
            </ul>

                move in such manner to resemble a lion's mane, they are even longer than a blue whale in length as
