                <li>Blue Whales communicate using a low frequency noise that can be heard as far as hundreds of miles

            <p>the Colossal squid takes it's place among the largest Creatures on the planet, bigger than the more well
                known giant squid! however, it is a very rare creature and has no truly well defined appearance or

                such being</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, said to measure about 27cm across, about the size
                    of a sports ball!</li>
                <li>most instances have recorded this sea beast to be about 15 meters long, and between 1,100 and 1,500
                    pounds! </li>
                <li>the only known creature to be hunting the colossal squid is the famed
